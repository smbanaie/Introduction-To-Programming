# Module 1: Computers and Programs

## Overview

This module provides a comprehensive introduction to computer systems and the fundamentals of program execution. Students will gain a deep understanding of computer architecture, the relationship between hardware and software, and the processes that transform human-readable code into machine-executable instructions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

- Explain the fundamental components of computer systems (CPU, RAM, storage, I/O)
- Understand the relationship between hardware and software
- Describe how programs are executed by computer systems
- Differentiate between source code, machine code, and bytecode
- Explain the concepts of compilation and interpretation
- Understand the Python execution model

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with using computers and software applications
- No prior programming experience required

## Module Structure

### Session 1: What Is a Computer? How Programs Run
