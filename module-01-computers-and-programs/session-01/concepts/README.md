# Session 1 Concepts: Computer Fundamentals

Welcome! This section explains how computers work in plain language. No prior experience needed—if you're new to programming or computers, you're in the right place.

## 🌟 For Complete Beginners

**What is this?** These articles explain the basics of how computers work—from how programs run to how files are stored. Think of them as friendly guides that answer the "how" and "why" behind everyday computer use.

**How to read them:** Take your time. Each article starts with a simple summary, then goes deeper. You don't need to memorize everything—understanding the big picture matters most.

| 2 | [**⚙️ Operating System**](operating-system.md) | What is Windows/Mac/Linux? How does your computer start up? |
| 3 | [**🧠 Memory Architecture**](memory-architecture.md) | Why does your computer slow down with many tabs open? RAM vs storage explained. |
| 4 | [**📁 File System**](file-system.md) | How are files and folders organized? Where does your data actually live? |
| 5 | [**🔢 Binary Format**](binary-format.md) | Why do computers use 0s and 1s? How does everything become numbers? |

### Quick Reference

| Article | Key Questions |
|---------|---------------|
| Process Lifecycle | What is a process? Why do programs freeze or crash? |
| Memory Architecture | What is RAM? Why is it different from my hard drive? |
| File System | How do folders and paths work? What is a file system? |
| Binary Format | Why binary? How do computers store text and images? |

## 🎯 What You'll Learn (In Simple Terms)

After these articles, you'll be able to:

1. **Explain** what happens when you double-click an app
2. **Understand** why closing programs frees up memory
3. **Navigate** file systems and understand paths
4. **Grasp** why computers use binary (0s and 1s)
5. **Describe** what an operating system does for you

## 📖 How to Use These Articles

- **First time?** Read in order (Process → OS → Memory → File System → Binary)
- **Curious about one topic?** Jump to any article—each stands on its own
- **Something unclear?** Re-read the "In Plain Terms" or "Real-World Analogy" sections
- **Want to go deeper?** Check the "Further Reading" at the end of each article

## 💡 Big Ideas (The Themes That Connect Everything)

- **Programs need resources** — Memory, CPU time, and storage. The OS manages who gets what.
- **Everything is data** — Text, images, and programs all become 0s and 1s eventually.
- **Organization matters** — File systems and memory hierarchies help computers work efficiently.
- **Layers work together** — Hardware, OS, and your programs all cooperate behind the scenes.
