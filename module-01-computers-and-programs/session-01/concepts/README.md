# Session 1 Concepts: Computer Fundamentals

## Welcome, Future Programmer!

This section explains how computers work in plain, simple language. **No prior experience needed**—if you're new to programming or computers, you're in the right place.

> **What is this?** These articles explain the basics of how computers work—from how programs run to how files are stored. Think of them as friendly guides that answer the "how" and "why" behind everyday computer use.

## How to Use These Articles

**First time here?** We recommend reading in order (top to bottom). Each article builds on concepts from the previous ones.

**Just curious about one topic?** Jump to any article—each is designed to stand on its own with plenty of context.

**Something unclear?** Re-read the "In Plain Terms" or "Real-World Analogy" sections. That's where we explain things most simply.

**Want to go deeper?** Check the "Further Reading" at the end of each article.

## 💡 Big Ideas (The Themes That Connect Everything)

As you read, watch for these recurring themes:

│     ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════       │
│     You don't need to know how the engine works to drive a car.     │
│     Similarly, you don't need to understand binary to write code.   │
│     Each layer hides complexity while providing useful features.     │
│                                                                      │

│     ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════       │
│     Memory, CPU time, and storage are limited.                      │
│     The OS manages who gets what, when, and for how long.          │
│                                                                      │

│     ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════       │
│     Text, images, music, and programs all become 0s and 1s         │
│     at the lowest level. Encoding schemes translate between        │
│     human concepts and binary representation.                       │
│                                                                      │
│  4. ORGANIZATION MATTERS                                               │
│     ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════       │
│     File systems, memory hierarchies, and process management         │
│     all exist to keep information organized and accessible.        │
│                                                                      │

│     ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════       │
│     Hardware, OS, and your programs all cooperate behind the       │
│     scenes. Understanding one helps you understand the others.      │
│                                                                      │

## 🔧 Hands-On Activities

Don't just read—try these experiments on your own computer:

### Activity 1: Observe Processes
- Open Task Manager (Windows: Ctrl+Shift+Esc) or Activity Monitor (Mac)
- Watch how many processes run when your computer is "idle"
- Open a web browser and watch new processes appear
- Close the browser and see what happens

### Activity 2: Check Your Memory
- Find out how much RAM your computer has
- Open many browser tabs and watch memory usage increase
- Close tabs and observe the change
- Notice how your computer responds differently when memory is full

### Activity 3: Explore Your File System
- Navigate to your home folder
- Create a well-organized folder structure for a project
- Practice using absolute and relative paths
- Try the command line (optional but powerful!)

### Activity 4: Understand Binary
- Use an online binary converter to encode your name
- Calculate the file size of a simple text document
- Look at the file sizes of different images (JPG vs PNG vs BMP)

## 🤔 When You Get Stuck

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Concept seems too complex** | Read the "In Plain Terms" section again. Skip the technical details, focus on the analogy. |
| **Too many new terms** | Don't worry about memorizing. Understanding the concept is more important than knowing terminology. |
| **Can't visualize it** | Look for the ASCII diagrams. Draw your own simplified version on paper. |
| **Want to skip ahead** | That's fine! You can read in any order. Just know that later articles may reference earlier concepts. |
| **Information overload** | Take a break. Learn one concept per session. These articles will still be here tomorrow! |

## 🎓 Before You Begin

**Prerequisites:**
- None! These articles assume zero prior knowledge.

**Helpful but not required:**
- Basic computer use (opening files, using a web browser)
- Curiosity about how things work

**What you DON'T need:**
- Math beyond basic arithmetic
- Previous programming experience
- Technical background

## 📝 How to Take Notes

Consider keeping a simple notebook with:

1. **Key Concepts** (one sentence each)
2. **Analogies that helped you** (kitchen, library, office desk)
3. **Questions** (to research later)
4. **"Aha!" moments** (when something clicked)

Example note format:
```
Process vs Program:
- Process = program actually running (like cooking a meal)
- Program = file on disk with instructions (like a recipe)
- Analogy helped me understand!

Question: What happens to a process when my laptop battery dies?
```

## 💬 Need Help?

Remember:
- **No question is too basic.** If you're wondering something, others are too.
- **Re-read sections** that confuse you. Sometimes a second pass makes all the difference.
- **Focus on understanding**, not memorizing. You can always look up details later.
- **Try the hands-on activities.** Doing is often better than just reading.
