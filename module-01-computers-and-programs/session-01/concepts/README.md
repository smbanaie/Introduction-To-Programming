# Session 1 Concepts: Computer Fundamentals

This folder contains detailed articles about key computer science concepts covered in Session 1. These articles provide deeper explanations to supplement the lecture material.

## Table of Contents

### Core Computer Concepts
- **🔄 [Process Lifecycle](process-lifecycle.md)**: How programs execute as processes
- **🧠 [Memory Architecture](memory-architecture.md)**: Computer memory systems and management
- **📁 [File System](file-system.md)**: Data organization and storage structures

### Fundamental Computing Principles
- **🔢 [Binary Format](binary-format.md)**: Why computers use binary representation
- **⚙️ [Operating System](operating-system.md)**: System management and boot processes

## Detailed Article Descriptions

### 🔄 [Process Lifecycle](process-lifecycle.md)
Learn how programs come to life as processes, from creation to termination. Understand process states, resource management, and the operating system's role in process coordination.

### 🧠 [Memory Architecture](memory-architecture.md)
Explore how computers organize and manage memory. Learn about RAM, cache memory, virtual memory, and the memory hierarchy that makes computers efficient.

### 📁 [File System](file-system.md)
Understand how data is organized on storage devices. Learn about file system structures, directory hierarchies, file operations, and common file system types.

### 🔢 [Binary Format](binary-format.md)
Discover why computers use binary (0s and 1s) and how all digital information is represented. Learn about binary operations, data encoding, and why binary is fundamental to computing.

### ⚙️ [Operating System](operating-system.md)
Explore the software that manages your computer. Learn about OS responsibilities, the boot process, system architecture, and how operating systems coordinate hardware and software.

## How to Use These Articles

1. **Read sequentially**: Start with Process Lifecycle, then Memory Architecture
2. **Supplement lectures**: Use after watching lecture videos
3. **Reference guide**: Return to specific articles when needed
4. **Discussion starters**: Use examples for class discussions

## Key Themes

- **Hardware/Software Interaction**: How physical components work with programs
- **Resource Management**: How computers allocate and manage limited resources
- **Data Organization**: How information is stored, accessed, and processed
- **System Coordination**: How different components work together

## Prerequisites

These articles assume you've watched the Session 1 lecture. They build on the basic concepts introduced there with more detailed explanations and additional examples.

## Next Steps

After reading these concepts, you'll be ready for:
- Session 2: From Source Code to Machine Code
- Module 2: Digital Information (bits, bytes, binary numbers)
- Practical programming exercises
