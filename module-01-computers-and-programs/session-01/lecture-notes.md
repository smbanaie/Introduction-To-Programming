# Session 1: What Is a Computer? How Programs Run

## Lecture Overview
**Duration**: 90 minutes  
**Objectives**: Students will understand what computers are and how programs execute on them  
**Materials**: Whiteboard, computer components diagram, program execution flow chart

---

## I. Introduction (15 minutes)

### Welcome and Hook (5 minutes)
- **Question to class**: "What do you think happens when you click an app icon on your phone?"
- **Discussion**: Share responses - most people know apps "run" but don't know how
- **Reveal**: Today we'll demystify how computers work and how programs execute

### Learning Goals (5 minutes)
By the end of this session, you will be able to:
- Describe the main components of a computer and their roles
- Explain how programs execute from start to finish
- Differentiate between hardware and software
- Understand why computers follow instructions literally

### Agenda Overview (5 minutes)
1. What is a computer? (Hardware components)
2. How programs run (Software execution)
3. Real-world examples
4. Q&A and wrap-up

## II. Main Content (50 minutes)

### A. What Is a Computer? (20 minutes)

#### Computer Components Breakdown

| Component | What It Does | Real-World Analogy |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **CPU (Central Processing Unit)** | The "brain" - executes instructions | A chef following a recipe |
| **RAM (Memory)** | Temporary storage for running programs | Chef's countertop workspace |
| **Storage (Hard Drive/SSD)** | Long-term data storage | Kitchen pantry |
| **Input Devices** | Ways to send information to computer | Ingredients you bring to kitchen |
| **Output Devices** | Ways computer shows results | Finished dishes |

#### Hardware vs Software Discussion (10 minutes)
- **Hardware**: Physical components you can touch
- **Software**: Instructions that tell hardware what to do
- **Analogy**: Hardware is like a car, software is like the driver

```
Computer Architecture Diagram:

[Input Devices] → [CPU] ←→ [RAM]
                    ↓
[Output Devices] ←→ [Storage]
```

### B. How Programs Run (20 minutes)

#### Program Execution Pipeline
```
1. Human writes SOURCE CODE (English-like instructions)
   ↓
2. Translator converts to MACHINE CODE (binary instructions)
   ↓
3. CPU executes instructions one by one
   ↓
4. Results sent to output devices
```

#### Key Concepts
- **Source Code**: Human-readable programming instructions
- **Machine Code**: Binary instructions computers understand
- **Execution**: CPU following instructions step-by-step
- **Literal Execution**: Computers do exactly what you tell them (no assumptions)

#### Real-World Program Examples (10 minutes)
- **Calculator App**: Takes numbers → performs math → shows result
- **Word Processor**: Takes typing → formats text → displays document
- **Web Browser**: Takes URL → fetches webpage → renders content

## III. Interactive Activities (15 minutes)

### Group Activity: Program Execution Role-Play (10 minutes)
- Divide class into groups of 3-4
- Each group acts out a simple program (like making a sandwich)
- One person = CPU, one = Memory, one = Storage, one = I/O
- Discuss: What happens if instructions are unclear?

### Think-Pair-Share: Computer in Daily Life (5 minutes)
- Think: Identify 5 programs you used today
- Pair: Share with partner
- Share: Class discussion on most common programs

## IV. Wrap-Up and Assessment (10 minutes)

### Key Takeaways (5 minutes)
1. **Computers have 5 main components**: CPU, RAM, Storage, Input, Output
2. **Programs execute through a pipeline**: Source → Machine Code → CPU Execution
3. **Hardware needs software**: Physical components require instructions to function
4. **Computers are literal**: They follow instructions exactly as written

### Exit Ticket Questions (3 minutes)
Students write answers to:
1. Name the 5 main computer components and their roles
2. Explain the difference between hardware and software
3. Why do computers follow instructions literally?

### Preview of Next Session (2 minutes)
"Next time we'll explore how source code becomes machine code - the translation process that makes programming possible!"
