# Session 2 Concepts: How Code Comes to Life

## Welcome, Future Programmer!

You've written your first lines of code, but have you ever wondered **what actually happens** when you run a program? This section pulls back the curtain to show you how code transforms from human-readable text into instructions your computer can execute.

> **What is this?** These articles explain the journey of code—from the Python you type to the instructions your CPU executes. Understanding this helps you write better code, debug effectively, and appreciate why different programming languages exist.

## What You'll Learn (Big Picture)

Before diving in, here's the simple story:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    THE JOURNEY OF YOUR CODE                          │

│                                                                      │
│  1. YOU WRITE CODE                                                   │
│     You type Python code that humans understand                     │
│     print("Hello, World!")                                          │
│                                                                      │

│  2. CODE GETS TRANSLATED                                             │
│     Python converts your code to an intermediate format              │
│     (called "bytecode")                                             │
│                                                                      │
│            ↓                                                         │
│  3. VIRTUAL MACHINE RUNS IT                                          │
│     Python's Virtual Machine reads bytecode step by step           │
│                                                                      │
│            ↓                                                         │
│  4. CPU EXECUTES INSTRUCTIONS                                        │
│     Your computer's CPU performs the actual work                   │
│     and "Hello, World!" appears on screen                             │
│                                                                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**That's it!** Every program you write goes through some version of this process.

## 🛠️ Hands-On Activities

Don't just read—try these experiments:

### Activity 1: See Python Bytecode

```python
import dis

# Define a simple function
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

# Disassemble it to see bytecode
print("Bytecode for add_numbers:")
dis.dis(add_numbers)
```

**Run this code and observe:**
- What instructions does Python generate?
- How many steps for a simple addition?

### Activity 2: Find Compiled Python Files

1. Run a Python program: `python my_program.py`
2. Look for a `__pycache__` folder in the same directory
3. Inside, you'll see `.pyc` files—these are the compiled bytecode!
4. Try opening one (it's binary, but you can see the structure)

### Activity 3: Compare Different Programming Styles

Create the same program three ways:

```python
# 1. Imperative style (step by step)
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sum_result = 0
for n in numbers:
    sum_result += n
print(sum_result)

# 2. Functional style (using built-in functions)
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(sum(numbers))

# 3. Object-oriented style (using objects)
class Calculator:
    def sum_list(self, numbers):
        return sum(numbers)

calc = Calculator()
print(calc.sum_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
```

**Notice:** Same result, different ways of thinking about it!
