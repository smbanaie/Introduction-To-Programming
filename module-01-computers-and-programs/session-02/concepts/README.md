# Session 2 Concepts: Code Translation and Execution

This folder contains detailed articles about how programming languages translate and execute code. These concepts build on the compilation vs interpretation discussion from the lecture.

## Table of Contents

### Code Translation Fundamentals
- **🔄 [Source Code vs Machine Code vs Bytecode](source-machine-bytecode.md)**: Three forms of computer programs
- **⚙️ [The Compilation Process](compilation-process.md)**: Complete compilation pipeline
- **🎭 [The Interpretation Process](interpretation-process.md)**: Line-by-line code execution

### Programming Language Theory
- **🏗️ [Programming Language Paradigms](programming-paradigms.md)**: Different approaches to programming
- **🐍 [Python's Execution Model](python-execution-model.md)**: Python's hybrid approach

## Detailed Article Descriptions

### 🔄 [Source Code vs Machine Code vs Bytecode](source-machine-bytecode.md)
Explore the three main forms of computer programs: human-readable source code, CPU-executable machine code, and the hybrid bytecode format. Understand why multiple forms exist and how they work together.

### ⚙️ [The Compilation Process](compilation-process.md)
Dive deep into how compilers translate source code to machine code. Learn about lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation - the complete compilation pipeline.

### 🎭 [The Interpretation Process](interpretation-process.md)
Understand how interpreters execute code line-by-line without compilation. Learn about the interpretation cycle, different interpreter types, and why Python uses a hybrid approach.

### 🏗️ [Programming Language Paradigms](programming-paradigms.md)
Discover different fundamental approaches to programming: imperative, functional, object-oriented, and logic programming. Understand how paradigms influence language design and problem-solving.

### 🐍 [Python's Execution Model](python-execution-model.md)
Explore Python's unique hybrid approach combining compilation and interpretation. Learn about bytecode, the Python Virtual Machine, memory management, and how Python code really executes.

## How to Use These Articles

1. **Build on lecture**: Read after watching the Session 2 lecture about compilation vs interpretation
2. **Progressive learning**: Start with source/machine/bytecode, then dive into specific processes
3. **Compare approaches**: Use the paradigm article to understand why different languages work differently
4. **Python focus**: End with Python's model to understand the language you're learning

## Key Themes

- **Translation mechanisms**: How human code becomes computer instructions
- **Performance trade-offs**: Speed vs flexibility in different execution models
- **Language philosophy**: Why programming languages are designed differently
- **Python's uniqueness**: How Python combines the best of compilation and interpretation

## Prerequisites

These articles assume you've watched the Session 2 lecture covering:
- Source code vs machine code concepts
- Compilation vs interpretation basics
- Python's bytecode approach

## Learning Objectives

After reading these articles, you'll understand:
- Why programming languages need translation
- The complete compilation pipeline
- How interpretation works in practice
- Different philosophical approaches to programming
- Why Python's model is particularly effective for beginners

## Next Steps

After mastering these concepts, you'll be ready for:
- Session 3: Data representation (bits, bytes, binary)
- Understanding why data needs special handling
- How programming languages represent information
- Memory and storage systems
