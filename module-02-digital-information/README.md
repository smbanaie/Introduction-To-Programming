# Module 2: Digital Information

## Module Overview

Building on your understanding of computers from Module 1, this module explores how all information is represented digitally. You'll discover that everything in computing - from text messages to images to programs themselves - ultimately becomes 0s and 1s. This module bridges the physical world of computer hardware with the abstract world of data manipulation.

By understanding how information is stored and processed, you'll gain insight into why programming languages work the way they do and how computers handle different types of data.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- **Explain** how bits and bytes represent all digital information
- **Convert** between binary, decimal, and hexadecimal number systems
- **Perform** basic binary arithmetic operations
- **Describe** how text is encoded using character systems
- **Understand** the relationship between data representation and computer operations
- **Apply** number system conversions to real programming scenarios
