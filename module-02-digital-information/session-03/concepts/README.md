# Session 3 Concepts: Bits, Bytes, and Data Fundamentals

This folder contains detailed articles about the fundamental building blocks of digital information. These concepts build on the lecture about bits, bytes, and data representation.

## Table of Contents

### Core Digital Concepts
- **🔢 [Bits and Bytes Fundamentals](bits-bytes-fundamentals.md)**: The basic units of digital information
- **💾 [Data Storage Units](data-storage-units.md)**: Measuring and understanding data quantities

### Data Representation
- **📊 [Data Representation](data-representation.md)**: How different types of information become digital
- **🌐 [Digital vs Analog](digital-vs-analog.md)**: The fundamental difference between continuous and discrete information

## Detailed Article Descriptions

### 🔢 [Bits and Bytes Fundamentals](bits-bytes-fundamentals.md)
Learn about the smallest units of digital information: bits and bytes. Understand why computers use binary, how bytes are constructed, and the hierarchy of data storage units from kilobytes to terabytes.

### 💾 [Data Storage Units](data-storage-units.md)
Master the language of data measurement. Understand the difference between decimal and binary prefixes, practical file sizes, and how to calculate storage needs and transfer times.

### 📊 [Data Representation](data-representation.md)
Explore how all types of information - numbers, text, images, sound, and video - are converted to digital form. Learn about sampling, quantization, compression, and different data structures.

### 🌐 [Digital vs Analog](digital-vs-analog.md)
Understand the fundamental difference between analog (continuous) and digital (discrete) information. Learn why digital dominates computing and how analog signals are converted to digital.

## How to Use These Articles

1. **Start with fundamentals**: Read bits-bytes and storage units first
2. **Build understanding**: Then explore data representation
3. **Compare paradigms**: Finish with digital vs analog
4. **Apply practically**: Use examples to understand real-world data sizes

## Key Themes

- **Digital foundations**: How all information becomes 0s and 1s
- **Measurement systems**: Understanding data quantities and storage
- **Representation techniques**: Converting real-world information to digital
- **Digital advantages**: Why discrete representation dominates computing
