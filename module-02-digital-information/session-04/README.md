# Session 4: Number Bases – Binary, Decimal, Hexadecimal

## Session Overview

Today we explore number systems beyond our familiar decimal system. We'll learn binary (base 2) and hexadecimal (base 16), understand place value in different bases, and practice converting between them. This session builds directly on our understanding of bits and bytes from last week.

## Key Learning Objectives

- Explain what a number base is
- Convert small numbers between decimal and binary
- Recognize hexadecimal notation and its purpose
- Relate binary numbers to bits and bytes

## Main Concepts

- Base 10 (decimal): Our usual system
- Base 2 (binary): Using digits 0 and 1
- Base 16 (hexadecimal): Using digits 0-9 and A-F
- Place value: Ones, twos, fours, eights… vs ones, tens, hundreds

## Workshop Activities

1. Convert decimal numbers (0-31) to binary
2. Practice with binary blocks or manipulatives
3. Convert between binary and hexadecimal

## Homework

- Conversion drills (10-15 small numbers)
- Explain binary-to-decimal conversion in your own words
- Optional: Convert small decimals to hex
