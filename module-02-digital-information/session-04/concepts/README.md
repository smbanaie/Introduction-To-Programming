# Session 4 Concepts: Number Systems and Conversions

This folder contains detailed articles about number systems and conversions. These concepts build on the binary, decimal, and hexadecimal systems introduced in the lecture.

## Table of Contents

### Binary Number System
- **🔢 [Binary Number System](binary-number-system.md)**: How computers count in base 2
- **📐 [Decimal-Binary Conversion](decimal-binary-conversion.md)**: Converting between human and computer number systems

### Hexadecimal System
- **🔗 [Hexadecimal System](hexadecimal-system.md)**: Binary's compact representation for humans

## Detailed Article Descriptions

### 🔢 [Binary Number System](binary-number-system.md)
Master the fundamental number system that computers use. Learn how binary place values work, binary arithmetic, and how binary relates to computer architecture and data types.

### 📐 [Decimal-Binary Conversion](decimal-binary-conversion.md)
Learn the essential skill of converting between decimal (human) and binary (computer) number systems. Master both directions of conversion with multiple methods and practice examples.

### 🔗 [Hexadecimal System](hexadecimal-system.md)
