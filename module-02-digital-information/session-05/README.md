# Session 5: Simple Binary Arithmetic

## Session Overview

Building on binary number representation, today we learn how computers add numbers. We'll explore binary addition rules, carry operations, and understand overflow conceptually.

## Key Learning Objectives

- Perform simple binary addition
- Understand carries in binary
- Explain how computers add numbers
- Recognize overflow limits

## Main Concepts

- Binary addition rules (0+0, 0+1, 1+0, 1+1)
- Carrying when sums exceed 1
- Overflow with fixed bit sizes
- Connection to hardware adders
