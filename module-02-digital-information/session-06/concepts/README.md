# Session 6 Concepts: Text Representation and Processing

This folder contains detailed articles about how text is represented and processed in computers. These concepts build on the character encoding discussion from the lecture.

## Table of Contents

### Character Encoding Fundamentals
- **🔤 [Character Encoding](character-encoding.md)**: How text becomes digital data
- **📝 [Text Encoding Standards](text-encoding-standards.md)**: From ASCII to Unicode systems

### Text Processing
- **🔧 [String Operations](string-operations.md)**: Manipulating and processing text data

## Detailed Article Descriptions

### 🔤 [Character Encoding](character-encoding.md)
Master the fundamentals of character encoding. Learn how ASCII, Unicode, and UTF-8 work to convert human-readable text into digital data that computers can process and store.

### 📝 [Text Encoding Standards](text-encoding-standards.md)
Explore the evolution of text encoding from simple ASCII to comprehensive Unicode systems. Understand encoding standards, UTF formats, and how to handle text in multiple languages.

### 🔧 [String Operations](string-operations.md)
Dive into string manipulation techniques. Learn indexing, slicing, formatting, searching, and advanced text processing operations used in programming.
