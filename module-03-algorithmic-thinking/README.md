# Module 3: Algorithmic Thinking

## Module Overview

Now that you understand how computers work and how data is represented, this module focuses on the most important programming skill: thinking algorithmically. You'll learn to break down problems into clear, step-by-step solutions before writing any code. This systematic approach to problem-solving is what separates good programmers from great ones.

By mastering algorithmic thinking, you'll develop a mental toolkit that applies to any programming language and problem domain.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- **Define** what algorithms are and identify their key properties
- **Design** step-by-step solutions using input-process-output models
- **Write** clear algorithms in natural language and pseudocode
- **Decompose** complex problems into manageable algorithmic steps
- **Apply** algorithmic thinking to real-world problem-solving
- **Translate** algorithms into structured pseudocode notation
