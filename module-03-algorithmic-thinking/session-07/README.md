# Session 7: From Data to Problems – Inputs, Outputs, and State

## Session Overview

Today we connect data representation to problem-solving by exploring input-process-output models and internal state. This bridges our understanding of data with algorithmic thinking.

## Key Learning Objectives

- Identify inputs, outputs, and state in systems
- Describe programs as data transformers
- Relate stored data to problem-solving
- Prepare for algorithmic expression
