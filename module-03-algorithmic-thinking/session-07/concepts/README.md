# Session 7 Concepts: Input-Process-Output and State

This folder contains detailed articles about the fundamental concepts of problem solving and system design. These concepts build on the IPO model and state management introduced in the lecture.

## Table of Contents

### IPO Fundamentals
- **🔄 [Input-Process-Output](input-process-output.md)**: The universal model for system behavior
- **💾 [State Management](state-management.md)**: How systems remember and track information

### IPO in Practice
- **🌍 [IPO Real-World Applications](ipo-real-world-applications.md)**: Practical examples across different domains

## Detailed Article Descriptions

### 🔄 [Input-Process-Output](input-process-output.md)
Master the fundamental IPO model that underlies all computational systems. Learn how to analyze and design systems by clearly separating input, processing, and output phases with practical examples and error handling strategies.

### 💾 [State Management](state-management.md)
Understand how programs and systems maintain and modify state over time. Learn about different types of state, stateful vs stateless operations, persistence, and common challenges in state management.

### 🌍 [IPO Real-World Applications](ipo-real-world-applications.md)
Explore how the IPO model appears in real-world systems from consumer electronics to industrial automation. See practical examples of IPO in smartphones, business applications, scientific systems, and software development.
