# Session 8: What Is an Algorithm? Natural Language Descriptions

## Session Overview

We begin our algorithmic thinking journey by defining what algorithms are and describing them in plain language. We'll explore everyday algorithms and the properties that make them effective.

## Key Learning Objectives

- Define algorithm in programming context
- Describe simple algorithms naturally
- Identify inputs, outputs, and steps
- Appreciate multiple solutions to problems
