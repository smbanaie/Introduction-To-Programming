## II. Main Content (50 minutes)

### A. Algorithm Definition (15 minutes)

#### What is an Algorithm?
- **Algorithm**: A finite set of unambiguous instructions for solving a problem
- **Step-by-step**: Clear, ordered sequence of actions
- **Problem-solving**: Designed to accomplish a specific task
- **Unambiguous**: Each step clearly defined, no interpretation needed

#### Algorithm Examples

**Finding a Word in Dictionary:**
1. Open dictionary to middle
2. Compare target word with middle word
3. If target comes before middle, search left half
4. If target comes after middle, search right half
5. Repeat until word found or determined missing

**Making Coffee:**
1. Fill kettle with water
2. Plug in kettle and turn on
3. Place coffee in mug
4. Wait for water to boil
5. Pour boiling water over coffee
6. Stir and wait 4 minutes
7. Add milk/sugar if desired

### B. Algorithm Characteristics (20 minutes)

#### Key Properties

| Characteristic | Description | Importance |
|----------------|-------------|------------|
| **Finite** | Must eventually stop | Prevents infinite loops |
| **Definite** | Each step clearly defined | No ambiguity in execution |
| **Effective** | Must be possible to perform | Practical feasibility |
| **Input** | May accept input data | Handles different scenarios |
| **Output** | Produces result | Measurable outcome |

#### Algorithm vs Recipe Comparison

| Aspect | Recipe | Algorithm |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Precision** | Approximate measurements | Exact specifications |
| **Ambiguity** | "Mix until combined" | "Stir for 30 seconds" |
| **Termination** | Cooking time ends | Guaranteed to finish |
| **Error handling** | "If too salty, add water" | Specific correction steps |

#### Algorithm Efficiency
- **Time complexity**: How long algorithm takes
- **Space complexity**: How much memory needed
- **Optimality**: Best possible solution approach

### C. Algorithm Analysis (15 minutes)

#### Correctness
- **Does it work?**: Produces correct output for all inputs
- **Edge cases**: Handles unusual inputs properly
- **Verification**: Prove algorithm correctness

#### Real-World Algorithms
- **Search algorithms**: Finding information
- **Sort algorithms**: Organizing data
- **Route planning**: GPS navigation
- **Compression**: File size reduction

#### Algorithm Representation
- **Natural language**: English descriptions
- **Pseudocode**: Structured English
- **Flowcharts**: Visual diagrams
- **Programming code**: Actual implementation

## III. Interactive Activities (15 minutes)

### Algorithm Creation Challenge (10 minutes)
- **Pairs**: Create algorithms for simple tasks
- **Examples**: Brushing teeth, crossing street, doing laundry
- **Criteria**: Must be finite, definite, effective

### Algorithm Evaluation (5 minutes)
- **Groups**: Review algorithms for characteristics
- **Check**: Finite? Definite? Effective? Input/Output clear?
- **Improve**: Suggest enhancements

## IV. Wrap-Up and Assessment (10 minutes)

### Key Takeaways (5 minutes)
1. **Algorithms are precise instructions**: Clear, unambiguous steps to solve problems
2. **Key characteristics**: Finite, definite, effective, with input/output
3. **Different from recipes**: Require precision and guaranteed completion
4. **Foundation of programming**: All programs are algorithms in code
