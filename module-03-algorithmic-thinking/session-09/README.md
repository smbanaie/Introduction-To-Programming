# Session 9: Pseudocode and Basic Control Structures

## Session Overview

Today we move from natural language to structured pseudocode, learning sequence, decision (if), and repetition (loops) constructs that form the foundation of all programming.

## Key Learning Objectives

- Write simple algorithms in pseudocode
- Use sequence, selection, and iteration
- Express classic algorithms (max, search) in pseudocode
- Prepare to map pseudocode to Python
