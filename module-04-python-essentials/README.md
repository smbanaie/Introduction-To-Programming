- Sets: unordered collections of unique elements

## Key Concepts

### Python Syntax Fundamentals
- **Statements and Expressions**: Building blocks of Python programs
- **Indentation**: Python's use of whitespace for code structure
- **Comments**: Documentation and code explanation
- **Naming Conventions**: PEP 8 style guidelines

### Data Types and Structures
- **Primitive Types**: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`
- **Sequence Types**: `list`, `tuple`, `range`
- **Mapping Types**: `dict`
- **Set Types**: `set`, `frozenset`

### Control Flow
- **Conditional Execution**: Decision-making in programs
- **Iteration**: Repeating operations with loops
- **Exception Handling**: Managing runtime errors
- **Program Flow**: Sequential, conditional, and iterative execution

## Python Development Environment

### Required Tools
- **Python Interpreter**: Version 3.8 or higher
- **Code Editor**: VS Code, PyCharm, or similar
- **Terminal/Command Prompt**: For running Python scripts
- **Python Package Manager**: pip for package installation

### Development Workflow
1. **Write**: Create Python scripts with `.py` extension
2. **Run**: Execute scripts via command line or IDE
3. **Debug**: Identify and fix errors in code
4. **Test**: Verify program behavior with different inputs
5. **Refactor**: Improve code structure and efficiency

## Programming Best Practices

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 Python style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write clear, readable code with appropriate comments
- Maintain consistent indentation and formatting

### Error Handling
- Anticipate potential runtime errors
- Use try-except blocks for exception management
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Test programs with edge cases

## Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this module, students will demonstrate:

1. **Programming Fundamentals**: Ability to write and execute basic Python programs
2. **Data Manipulation**: Skill in working with Python's built-in data types and structures
3. **Control Flow**: Understanding of conditional and iterative programming constructs
4. **Problem-Solving**: Application of programming concepts to solve computational problems
5. **Debugging**: Capacity to identify and resolve common programming errors
