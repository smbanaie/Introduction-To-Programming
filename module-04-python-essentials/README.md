# Module 4: Python Essentials

## Module Overview

Welcome to the coding phase of your programming journey! This module transitions you from algorithmic thinking to actual Python programming. You'll learn Python's syntax, data types, control structures, and fundamental programming concepts. By the end, you'll be able to write, run, and debug basic Python programs.

This module bridges the gap between understanding how computers work and actually programming them. You'll see how the concepts from previous modules translate into working code.

## Learning Objectives
