# Session 10 Concepts: Python Environment & First Steps

This folder contains detailed articles about getting started with Python programming. These concepts build on the lecture introduction to Python environment setup and basic programming concepts.

## Table of Contents

### Getting Started with Python
- **🐍 [Python Interpreter](python-interpreter.md)**: How Python code runs and the different ways to execute it
- **📝 [Basic Python Syntax](basic-python-syntax.md)**: Essential Python language rules and structure

### Development Tools
- **🛠️ [Python Development Environment](python-development-environment.md)**: Tools, editors, and best practices for Python development

## Detailed Article Descriptions

### 🐍 [Python Interpreter](python-interpreter.md)
Understand how Python executes code through its interpreter system. Learn about the Python Virtual Machine, different execution modes (interactive vs script), and various Python implementations available.

### 📝 [Basic Python Syntax](basic-python-syntax.md)
Master the fundamental rules of Python programming. Learn about statements, expressions, variables, data types, operators, and control flow structures that form the building blocks of Python programs.

### 🛠️ [Python Development Environment](python-development-environment.md)
Set up a professional Python development environment. Learn about editors, IDEs, package management, virtual environments, version control, and essential tools for Python development.
