# Session 11 Concepts: Variables & Data Types

This folder contains detailed articles about Python's variable system and built-in data types. These concepts build on the introduction to variables and types from the lecture.

## Table of Contents

### Variable Management
- **📦 [Python Variables](python-variables.md)**: How variables store and manage data
- **🔄 [Type Conversion](type-conversion.md)**: Changing between different data types

### Data Type System
- **📊 [Python Data Types](python-data-types.md)**: Built-in types for different kinds of data

## Detailed Article Descriptions

### 📦 [Python Variables](python-variables.md)
Master Python's variable system including naming rules, scope, memory management, and best practices for creating and managing variables effectively.

### 📊 [Python Data Types](python-data-types.md)
Explore Python's rich type system including numbers, text, booleans, and collections. Learn how each type works and when to use different data structures.

### 🔄 [Type Conversion](type-conversion.md)
Learn how to convert between different data types safely and effectively. Understand implicit vs explicit conversion, error handling, and common conversion patterns.

## How to Use These Articles

1. **Start with variables**: Understand how Python manages data storage
