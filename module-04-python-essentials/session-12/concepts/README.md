# Session 12 Concepts: Input/Output & Expressions

This folder contains detailed articles about input/output operations and expression evaluation in Python. These concepts build on the lecture covering user interaction and computational expressions.

## Table of Contents

### Input and Output Operations
- **📥 [Input and Output](input-output.md)**: Communicating with users and files
- **🔢 [Expressions and Operators](expressions-operators.md)**: Building computations with operators

### Expression Evaluation
- **⚖️ [Evaluation Order](evaluation-order.md)**: How Python processes expressions and operator precedence

## Detailed Article Descriptions

### 📥 [Input and Output](input-output.md)
Master Python's I/O capabilities including console input/output, file operations, and error handling. Learn how to read user input, display formatted output, work with files, and handle encoding properly.

### 🔢 [Expressions and Operators](expressions-operators.md)
Explore Python's rich operator system including arithmetic, comparison, logical, and bitwise operators. Learn how expressions are built and evaluated, with practical examples of operator usage.

### ⚖️ [Evaluation Order](evaluation-order.md)
Understand how Python evaluates complex expressions through operator precedence and associativity rules. Learn the complete precedence hierarchy and how to write clear, predictable expressions.

## How to Use These Articles

1. **Start with I/O**: Learn how programs communicate with the outside world
2. **Master expressions**: Understand how to build computational logic
3. **Study evaluation**: Learn the rules that govern expression processing
4. **Practice combining**: Use I/O and expressions together in real programs

## Key Themes

- **Program interaction**: Input from users and files, output to console and files
- **Computational building blocks**: Operators and expressions for calculations
- **Evaluation mechanics**: How Python processes complex expressions
- **Error handling**: Robust I/O and expression evaluation
