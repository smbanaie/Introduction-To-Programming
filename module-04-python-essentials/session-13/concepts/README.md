# Session 13 Concepts: Decision Making (if/elif/else)

This folder contains detailed articles about conditional statements and decision-making logic in Python. These concepts build on the lecture covering if/elif/else statements and boolean logic.

## Table of Contents

### Conditional Logic
- **🔀 [Conditional Statements](conditional-statements.md)**: Basic if/elif/else structures and patterns
- **🔵 [Boolean Logic](boolean-logic.md)**: True/false values and logical operators
- **📊 [Nested Conditionals](nested-conditionals.md)**: Complex decision trees and advanced patterns

## Detailed Article Descriptions

### 🔀 [Conditional Statements](conditional-statements.md)
Master Python's conditional statements including if/elif/else chains, truthy/falsy evaluation, comparison operators, and real-world applications like user authentication and shopping cart logic.

### 🔵 [Boolean Logic](boolean-logic.md)
Explore the foundation of decision making with boolean values, logical operators (AND, OR, NOT), truth tables, comparison operators, and practical applications in validation and access control.

### 📊 [Nested Conditionals](nested-conditionals.md)
Learn advanced conditional patterns including nested structures, guard clauses, decision trees, and refactoring techniques to avoid complex nested logic while maintaining clarity.

## How to Use These Articles

1. **Start with conditionals**: Learn the basic if/elif/else syntax and patterns
2. **Master boolean logic**: Understand how true/false values work in Python
3. **Explore nesting**: Learn when and how to create complex decision trees
4. **Apply in practice**: Use conditionals to solve real programming problems

## Key Themes

- **Decision making**: Controlling program flow based on conditions
- **Boolean evaluation**: How Python determines true/false values
- **Logical operations**: Combining conditions with AND, OR, NOT
- **Complex logic**: Handling multiple conditions and nested decisions
- **Code clarity**: Writing readable and maintainable conditional logic

## Prerequisites

These articles assume you've watched the Session 13 lecture covering:
- Basic if/else statements
- Comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, etc.)
- Introduction to boolean logic
- Simple conditional examples

## Learning Objectives

After reading these articles, you'll understand:
- Complete conditional statement syntax and patterns in Python
- Boolean logic, truth tables, and logical operators
- Complex nested conditional structures and when to use them
- Best practices for readable and maintainable conditional code
- Common mistakes and how to avoid them

## Next Steps

After mastering these concepts, you'll be ready for:
- Session 14: Loops (while/for)
- Learning iteration and repetition in Python
- Understanding different types of loops and their applications
- Working with collections and sequences
