# Session 14 Concepts: Loops (while/for)

This folder contains detailed articles about iteration and looping in Python. These concepts build on the lecture covering for loops, while loops, and loop control statements.

## Table of Contents

### For Loops
- **🔄 [For Loops](for-loops.md)**: Iterating over collections and sequences
- **🔂 [While Loops](while-loops.md)**: Conditional iteration patterns

### Loop Control
- **🎛️ [Loop Control](loop-control.md)**: Managing loop execution with break, continue, and else

## Detailed Article Descriptions

### 🔄 [For Loops](for-loops.md)
Master Python's for loops for iterating over collections, ranges, and custom iterables. Learn about enumerate, zip, list comprehensions, nested loops, and common iteration patterns.

### 🔂 [While Loops](while-loops.md)
Explore while loops for conditional iteration where the number of iterations is unknown. Learn about infinite loops, input validation, menu systems, and when to choose while over for loops.

### 🎛️ [Loop Control](loop-control.md)
Understand loop control statements (break, continue, pass) and the else clause with loops. Learn advanced control patterns for nested loops, early exits, and complex iteration scenarios.

## How to Use These Articles

1. **Start with for loops**: Learn the primary iteration mechanism in Python
2. **Explore while loops**: Understand conditional iteration patterns
3. **Master control statements**: Learn how to manage loop execution flow
4. **Apply in combination**: Use different loop types and control statements together

## Key Themes

- **Iteration patterns**: Different ways to loop through data
- **Loop selection**: Choosing between for and while loops
- **Control flow**: Managing when and how loops execute
- **Performance considerations**: Efficient looping techniques
- **Common patterns**: Reusable loop structures and algorithms

## Prerequisites

These articles assume you've watched the Session 14 lecture covering:
- Basic for loop syntax with range()
- Basic while loop structure
- Introduction to break and continue
- Simple iteration examples

## Learning Objectives

After reading these articles, you'll understand:
- Complete for loop usage including comprehensions and advanced patterns
- While loop applications and common pitfalls to avoid
- All loop control statements and their appropriate usage
- Performance implications of different looping approaches
- Best practices for readable and efficient loops

## Next Steps

After mastering these concepts, you'll be ready for:
- Session 15: Working with Strings
- Learning string operations, formatting, and manipulation
- Understanding string methods and text processing
- Building string-based applications
