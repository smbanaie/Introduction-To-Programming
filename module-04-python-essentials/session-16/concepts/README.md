# Session 16 Concepts: Collections (lists, dicts, etc.)

This folder contains detailed articles about Python's collection data structures. These concepts build on the lecture covering lists, dictionaries, and other collection types.

## Table of Contents

### Core Collections
- **📋 [Python Lists](python-lists.md)**: Mutable, ordered sequences for general-purpose use
- **🔑 [Python Dictionaries](python-dictionaries.md)**: Key-value mappings for fast lookups

### Specialized Collections
- **🔗 [Sets and Tuples](sets-tuples.md)**: Unique collections and immutable sequences

## Detailed Article Descriptions

### 📋 [Python Lists](python-lists.md)
Master Python's most versatile collection type. Learn list creation, indexing, slicing, modification operations, comprehensions, and performance considerations for working with ordered, mutable sequences.

### 🔑 [Python Dictionaries](python-dictionaries.md)
Explore Python's key-value data structure for fast lookups. Learn dictionary creation, access patterns, modification, iteration, and advanced techniques like comprehensions and default dictionaries.

### 🔗 [Sets and Tuples](sets-tuples.md)
Discover specialized collection types including immutable tuples for fixed data, sets for unique elements, named tuples for readable access, and frozen sets for hashable collections.

## How to Use These Articles

1. **Start with lists**: Learn Python's primary sequence type
2. **Master dictionaries**: Understand key-value data structures
3. **Explore specialized types**: Learn when to use sets and tuples
4. **Apply appropriate collections**: Choose the right data structure for your needs

## Key Themes

- **Data organization**: Different ways to store and access collections of data
- **Performance trade-offs**: Choosing collections based on access patterns and requirements
- **Immutability vs mutability**: When to use fixed vs changeable data structures
- **Set operations**: Mathematical operations on collections
- **Memory efficiency**: Choosing collections for optimal memory usage

## Prerequisites

These articles assume you've watched the Session 16 lecture covering:
- Basic list operations and methods
- Dictionary creation and access
- Introduction to sets and tuples
- Simple collection examples

## Learning Objectives

After reading these articles, you'll understand:
- Complete list operations including comprehensions and performance patterns
- Dictionary usage including advanced techniques and common patterns
- When and how to use sets, tuples, named tuples, and frozen sets
