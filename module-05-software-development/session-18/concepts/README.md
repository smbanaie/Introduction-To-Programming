# Session 18 Concepts: Basic Error Handling and Debugging

This folder contains detailed articles about exception handling, debugging techniques, and preventing common programming errors in Python. These concepts build on the lecture covering try/except blocks and basic debugging.

## Table of Contents

### Exception Handling
- **⚠️ [Exception Handling](exception-handling.md)**: Managing runtime errors with try/except blocks and context managers

### Debugging Techniques
- **🔍 [Debugging Techniques](debugging-techniques.md)**: Systematic approaches to finding and fixing program bugs

### Error Prevention
- **🛡️ [Common Errors](common-errors.md)**: Identifying and preventing frequent programming mistakes

## Detailed Article Descriptions

### ⚠️ [Exception Handling](exception-handling.md)
Master Python's exception handling mechanisms including try/except blocks, exception types, context managers, custom exceptions, and best practices for robust error handling in production code.

### 🔍 [Debugging Techniques](debugging-techniques.md)
Learn systematic debugging approaches including print debugging, logging, interactive debuggers, assertion testing, and strategies for reproducing, isolating, and fixing program errors.

### 🛡️ [Common Errors](common-errors.md)
Explore frequent programming mistakes including syntax errors, runtime errors, logical errors, and resource management issues, with prevention strategies and defensive programming techniques.

## How to Use These Articles

1. **Start with exception handling**: Learn how to manage runtime errors gracefully
2. **Master debugging techniques**: Develop systematic approaches to finding bugs
3. **Prevent common errors**: Learn to avoid and handle frequent programming mistakes
4. **Apply comprehensive error handling**: Combine all techniques for robust software
