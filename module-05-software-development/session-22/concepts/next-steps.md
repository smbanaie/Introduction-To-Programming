5. **Explain what you tried** - Shows effort

### Template:

```
I'm trying to [goal].

Here's my code:
[minimal code example]

When I run it, I get this error:
[full error message]

I tried [what you tried], but it didn't work.
What am I missing?
```

## Part 9: Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Shiny Object Syndrome

**Problem**: Constantly switching to new tutorials/courses

**Solution**: Finish what you start before moving on

### 2. Tutorial Hell

**Problem**: Only following tutorials, never building independently

**Solution**: Stop at 80% understanding, start building

### 3. Comparison Trap

**Problem**: "Others are so far ahead"

**Solution**: Compare yourself to past you, not others

### 4. Perfectionism

**Problem**: Never finishing because it's not perfect

**Solution**: Ship it, then improve. Done > Perfect.

### 5. Learning Without Doing

**Problem**: Reading/watching without practicing

**Solution**: Code along, then build your own version
