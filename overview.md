# Introduction to Programming Course

## Course Description

This 22-session course provides a gentle introduction to programming for complete beginners. Unlike traditional programming courses that dive directly into syntax, this course emphasizes understanding fundamental concepts first, then building programming skills step by step. Students will learn not just how to write Python code, but how to think like programmers.

The course follows a carefully designed progression: starting with computer fundamentals and data representation, moving through algorithmic thinking and pseudocode, and finally introducing Python syntax and practical programming projects.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this course, students will be able to:
- Understand how computers work at a fundamental level
- Explain how data is represented and stored digitally
- Design algorithms to solve problems step by step
- Write, run, and debug Python programs
- Build small but complete applications that integrate multiple concepts
- Think systematically about programming problems

## Course Modules

The course is organized around five interconnected modules:

### Module 1: Computer & Programming Fundamentals
- What computers are and their main components (CPU, memory, storage, I/O)
- How programs run on computers
- Source code vs. machine code
- Compilers vs. interpreters

### Module 2: Data Representation & Number Systems
- Bits, bytes, and how information is stored
- Binary, decimal, and hexadecimal number systems
- Text representation (ASCII and Unicode)
- Basic binary arithmetic

### Module 3: Algorithms & Pseudocode
- What algorithms are and why they matter
- Input-process-output model
- Designing step-by-step solutions
- Writing algorithms in natural language and pseudocode

### Module 4: Python Language Fundamentals
- Python environment setup and basic usage
- Variables, data types, and expressions
- Control structures (conditionals and loops)
- Working with strings and collections
- Functions and basic error handling

### Module 5: Practical Programming & Mini-Projects
- Reading and writing files
- Organizing code into modules
- Building complete programs
- Debugging and testing strategies

## Course Structure

The course consists of 22 weekly sessions organized into 5 learning modules, each building on the previous ones:

### **Module 1: Computer & Programming Fundamentals** (Sessions 1-2)
Computer basics and how programs work - the foundation for understanding programming.

### **Module 2: Data Representation & Number Systems** (Sessions 3-6)
How information is stored digitally - bits, bytes, binary, and text encoding.

### **Module 3: Algorithms & Pseudocode** (Sessions 7-9)
Thinking like a programmer - designing step-by-step solutions before writing code.

### **Module 4: Python Language Fundamentals** (Sessions 10-16)
Core Python programming - variables, control structures, data types, and basic operations.

### **Theme 5: Practical Programming & Mini-Projects** (Sessions 17-22)
Advanced concepts and real applications - functions, files, error handling, and complete programs.

## Target Audience

This course is designed for:
- Complete beginners with no prior programming experience
- Students interested in understanding "why" before "how"
- Those who want a solid conceptual foundation before diving into code
- Anyone curious about how computers and programming really work

## Prerequisites

- Basic computer literacy (using a mouse, keyboard, web browser)
- No prior programming experience required
- Willingness to think systematically and solve problems step by step

## How to Use This Repository

The course is organized into 5 thematic modules, each containing related sessions. Each session folder contains:

- **`README.md`**: Main concepts, explanations, and tutorial content for that session
- **`workshop/`**: Hands-on activities, starter code, and exercise prompts
- **`homeworks/`**: Homework assignments, descriptions, and starter templates

### Getting Started

1. **Environment Setup**: Before Module 4, set up Python on your computer
2. **Weekly Pace**: Complete one session per week, including workshops and homework
3. **Practice First**: Focus on understanding concepts before writing code
4. **Ask Questions**: Programming is about problem-solving - expect to get stuck and learn from it

## Course Philosophy

This course takes a "concepts first, syntax second" approach because:

1. **Understanding matters**: Knowing why things work helps you remember how
2. **Transferable skills**: Programming concepts apply across all languages
3. **Better debugging**: Understanding fundamentals makes errors less mysterious
4. **Sustainable learning**: Concepts stick better than memorized syntax
